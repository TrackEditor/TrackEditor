# TrackEditor

This is a small tool to edit GPX files. There are a number of tools that I periodically need to create my own GPS Tracks and export them in a single GPX file, such as: cut, split, reverse, add time, correct elevation... and always need more than one single tool to do this!

The single goal of this application is to load, visualize and edit your GPX files to create your custome track.

There are amazing tools to create tracks from scratch: komoot, strava... But any GPX aditor which matches my neecesities at 100%.
